MOVING PLAN

1 - Move over the HTML body contents into the index.html body

2 - Copy over the JS into the main.ts file

3 - Any onclick="fdsfdsfds()" won't work and need to to be switched to addEventListener

4 - Install and IMPORT Bootstrap into any JS file
RULE: Don't make your own script tags or link tags to connect JS or CSS files

5 - Break our app into at least 3 files and use import/export to keep it all working
(don't be afraid to do dumb things to force into 3 files)
You cannot change something that has been imported
Don't try to pull out a function that changes a variable in another file

6 - Make Typescript happy

1 - Your data
    * Make a named object type for each data object type
2 - Your parameters
3 - (just this week) Your HTML elements
